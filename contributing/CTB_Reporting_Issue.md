# Reporting an issue

GitHub offers the possibility to report an issue. This feature can be used if you think information is missing or notice a mistake but are unsure of how to change it using the [web editor](xref:CTB_Quick_Edit) or [GitHub Desktop](xref:CTB_Larger_Contribution). You can report an issue as follows:

1. Go to the [dataminer-docs repository](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/dataminer-docs) on GitHub.

1. In the top-left corner, select *Issues*.

1. Select *New issue*.

1. Choose a title for the issue and leave a comment.

1. Select *Submit new issue*.

The Skyline documentation team will review the issue and provide you with feedback.
