# Data API change log

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At present, the Data API feature is only available in preview, if the soft-launch option *DataAPI* is enabled. For more information, see [Getting started with the Data Sources module](xref:Data_Sources_Setup).

#### 1 April 2024 - New feature - DataAPI 1.1.3 - New configuration endpoint for units and decimals [ID_39016]

A new endpoint `<host address>/api/config` has been added, allowing users to configure units and decimals.

Example:

```json
{
    "decimals": {
        "Devices": [
            {
                "Connected devices": [
                    {
                        "Temperature": 2
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "Ping": 2
    },
    "units": {
        "Devices": [
            {
                "Connected devices": [
                    {
                        "Temperature": "degC"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "Ping": "ms"
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The *config* endpoint can only be used when an auto-generated connector exists, and the parameters specified in the request also exist.
> - The length of units is restricted to 30 characters to optimize display.
> - Because of the constraints of double precision in .NET, the number of digits is limited to 15. For example, when there are 5 digits before the decimal point, only 10 useful decimals can be shown.

#### 1 April 2024 - Enhancement - DataAPI 1.1.3 - OpenTelemetry support added [ID_39129]

*DataAPI* now supports OpenTelemetry.

#### 27 March 2024 - Fix - DataAPI 1.1.2 - Foreign key columns removed from trended parameters [ID_39196]

*DataAPI* no longer enables trending for foreign key columns.

#### 27 March 2024 - Enhancement - DataAPI 1.1.2 - Protocol namespace added in auto-generated connectors [ID_39198]

*DataAPI* now adds the protocol namespace `http://www.skyline.be/protocol` when a new connector is generated.

#### 15 March 2024 - New feature - DataAPI 1.1.1 - Cloud Node ID used to identify DxM instance and report DxM status [ID_39051]

The Cloud Node ID is now used to uniquely identify each DxM instance in a cluster and report back DxM health stats for remote monitoring of systems connected to dataminer.services.

In addition, the Node ID is now also used as an identifier when registering with APIGateway.

#### 14 March 2024 - Enhancement - DataAPI 1.1.0 - Upgrade to .NET 8 [ID_39022]

Data API has now been upgraded to use .NET 8 instead of .NET 6. This means .NET 8 Runtime now has to be installed in order to run Data API.

#### 14 March 2024 - Enhancement - DataAPI 1.0.2 - Improved installer robustness [ID_38981]

The Data API installer has been updated to mitigate a Windows DLL redirection vulnerability and to improve its robustness.

#### 02 March 2024 - Fix - DataAPI 1.0.1 - DataMiner icon added to application [ID_38839]

A DataMiner icon has been added to the DxM, which will now be used as the application icon in Task Manager.

#### 31 January 2024 - New feature - DataAPI 1.0.0 - New DataAPI module [ID_36542] [ID_36588] [ID_36575] [ID_37055] [ID_37337] [ID_37648] [ID_37796] [ID_37817] [ID_37837] [ID_37898] [ID_38088] [ID_38159] [ID_38570]

A new Data API module is now available as a DxM (DataMiner Extension Module).

It provides an HTTP API with the purpose of ingesting data into DataMiner. Within the HTTP body of the request, a JSON-formatted structure with key-value pairs can be provided. Data API will then, according to the provided JSON data, dynamically generate connectors with the corresponding standalone parameters, table, and columns.

##### Client Libraries [ID_36542]

Client libraries are now generated for the Data API HTTP web API. At present, C# and Python are supported. Other languages can use the HTTP API calls.

##### API Gateway module registration [ID_36575] [ID_37055] [ID_38570]

Data API will now register itself with API Gateway allowing for an overview of all node instances.

##### Decimals calculation for numeric parameters [ID_37337]

Data API will now calculate an appropriate number of decimals to use with numeric parameters based on the precision of the value provided upon creation of the parameter.

##### Auto-generated connector parameters [ID_37648] [ID_37837]

Parameters generated by Data API will use IDs within the range of 10 million (inclusive) to 11 million (exclusive).

They will be all be saved and trending will be enabled for them by default. Additionally, a trend template will be created and updated as new parameters are added.

##### Limit the size of API request [ID_37817]

A limitation has been implemented so that requests for Data API must remain under 1 MB in size. Larger requests will be rejected and will not be parsed.
