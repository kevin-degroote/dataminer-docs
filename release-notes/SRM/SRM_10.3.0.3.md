## Enhancements

#### Improved logging in case of invalid entry in Generic DVE Table [ID_38091]

Logging has been improved in case there is an invalid entry in the *Generic DVE Table* when the *SRM_DiscoverResources* script is used (i.e. when resources are provisioned). An error will be shown specifying which entry is invalid.

## Fixes

#### DTR not running correctly for auto-selected resource in silent booking [ID_37956]

In some cases, when data transfer rules (DTR) were triggered on automatic resource selection in a silent booking, and the DTR script had to retrieve the auto-selected resource, it could occur DTR did not run correctly.
