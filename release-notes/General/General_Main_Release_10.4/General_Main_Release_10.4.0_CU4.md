### Enhancements

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when creating multiple bookings simultaneously [ID_39390]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when creating multiple bookings simultaneously.

### Fixes

#### SLSNMPAgent would incorrectly interpret variable trap bindings of type 'IpAddress' as bindings of type 'OctetString' [ID_39425]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Up to now, SLSNMPAgent would incorrectly interpret variable trap bindings of type 'IpAddress' as bindings of type 'OctetString'.

#### Protocols: 'next' attribute would no longer work for SNMP parameters [ID_39430]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

The `next` attribute of a parameter inside a parameter group determines the number of milliseconds DataMiner has to wait before reading the next parameter. This functionality no longer worked for SNMP parameters.

Also, when a group contained single parameters in combination with a partial table, the single parameters would incorrectly also be requested each time the next batch of rows were requested from the partial table. From now on, the single parameters will only be requested once.

> [!NOTE]
> When a `next` attribute is defined on a partial SNMP table parameter inside a parameter group, then the delay will also be applied between the batches of rows that are requested.
