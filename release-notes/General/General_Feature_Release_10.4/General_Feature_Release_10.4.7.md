## Highlights

## New features

#### Factory reset tool: Additional actions [ID_39524] [ID_39530]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

The factory reset tool `SLReset.exe` will now perform the following additional actions:

- If the DataMiner Agent is connected to *dataminer.services*, disconnect the DataMiner Agent from *dataminer.services*.
- Clear all custom appsettings of the DataMiner extension modules (DxMs).

## Changes

### Enhancements

#### Service & Resource Management: Enhanced performance when creating multiple bookings simultaneously [ID_39390]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when creating multiple bookings simultaneously.

### Fixes

#### Issues with user accounts [ID_39234]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some cases, user accounts could become corrupted and group memberships could get lost.

Also, in some cases, SLDataMiner could stop working when an alarm template or trend template was uploaded, removed, assigned or unassigned.

#### MessageBroker: Problem when trying to read a file that was being updated by another process [ID_39408]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some rare cases, an exception could be thrown when MessageBroker tried to read a file that was being updated by another process.

#### SLSNMPAgent would incorrectly interpret variable trap bindings of type 'IpAddress' as bindings of type 'OctetString' [ID_39425]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

Up to now, SLSNMPAgent would incorrectly interpret variable trap bindings of type 'IpAddress' as bindings of type 'OctetString'.

#### Protocols: 'next' attribute would no longer work for SNMP parameters [ID_39430]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16]/10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

The `next` attribute of a parameter inside a parameter group determines the number of milliseconds DataMiner has to wait before reading the next parameter. This functionality no longer worked for SNMP parameters.

Also, when a group contained single parameters in combination with a partial table, the single parameters would incorrectly also be requested each time the next batch of rows were requested from the partial table. From now on, the single parameters will only be requested once.

> [!NOTE]
> When a `next` attribute is defined on a partial SNMP table parameter inside a parameter group, then the delay will also be applied between the batches of rows that are requested.

#### Problem when disposing an ISession with multiple subscriptions [ID_39483]

<!-- MR 10.5.0 - FR 10.4.7 -->

In some cases, an `InvalidOperationException` could be thrown when a .NET Framework host application (e.g. DataMiner Automation) disposed an ISession with multiple subscriptions without having disposed the subscriptions first.
