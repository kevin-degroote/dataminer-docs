### Enhancements

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: All trend patterns will now be loaded when you open a trend graph showing data from several parameters [ID_36661]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

Up to now, when you opened a trend graph showing data from several parameters, only the trend patterns of the first parameter would be loaded onto the graph. From now on, the trend patterns of all parameters shown on the graph will be loaded.

The SLAnalytics feature "pattern matching" has now fully been integrated in the Trending module.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: New rule with regard to adding agents to a cluster [ID_37075]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

Up to now, it was possible to have a DataMiner System in which some DMAs had been added by IP address while other DMAs had been added by hostname. As this could potentially lead to problems, especially in DataMiner Systems that include Failover pairs, the following rule has now been introduced:

- If the cluster includes any Failover pairs with shared hostname or any DMA with a hostname in its *IP address* field:

  - Allowed to add DMAs either by hostname or by IP address.
  - Allowed to create Failover pairs with shared hostname only.

- If the cluster includes any Failover pairs with virtual IP addresses:

  - Allowed to add DMAs IP address only.
  - Allowed to create Failover pairs with virtual IP addresses only.

- In all other cases:

  - Allowed to add DMAs either by hostname or by IP address.
  - Allowed to create Failover pairs with shared hostname or with virtual IP addresses.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm templates: Configuration of behavioral anomaly alarms [ID_37148] [ID_37171] [ID_37670]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

Up to now, the behavioral anomaly detection feature only allowed users to have alarms generated instead of suggestion events, depending on the parameter and the type of anomaly. From now on, when configuring an alarm template, users will have more options to specify what should happen when behavioral anomalies are detected.

For example, it is now possible to make a distinction between upward and downward behavioral changes (e.g. an upward spike or a downward spike). For example, you can request to have alarms only for upward level shifts and not for downward level shifts. However, in that case, it would still be possible to have suggestions for downward level shifts. Also, you can now fine-tune and decide to have an upward level shift alarm only when the level shift rises more than 10 (i.e. an absolute threshold of 10) or more than 10 percent of the current value (i.e. a relative threshold of 10).

To configure the behavioral anomaly detection for a particular (numeric) parameter, do the following:

1. Open the alarm template in the *Protocols & Templates* app.
1. In the right-most column of the parameter in question, click the *Anomalies* button to open the *Anomaly alarm settings* window.
1. In the *Anomaly alarm settings* window, optionally open the *Select preset* selection box, and select one of the following options:

   - "All disabled" (i.e. no anomaly alarms)
   - "All smart" (i.e. anomaly monitoring as it existed up to now)

1. Below the selection box, if necessary, you can fine-tune the configuration by specifying how anomaly monitoring should react to anomalies of type level shift, outlier, variance change, trend change and/or flatline.

1. Click *Close* to exit the *Anomaly alarm settings* window.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Closing this window does not yet save the changes you made in this window.

1. Back in the alarm template editor, click *OK* or *Apply* to save the changes you made.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The *Anomalies* button in the right-most column of the parameter in question will indicate the level of anomaly monitoring that has been configured:
   >
   > - "Disabled" (i.e. no anomaly alarms)
   > - "Customized" (i.e. the new customized anomaly monitoring)
   > - "Smart" (i.e. anomaly monitoring as it existed up to now).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - It is not possible to have both a suggestion event and an alarm generated for the same issue. However, it is possible to have suggestion events generated for e.g. downward level shifts, even if downward level shifts are disabled in the *Anomaly alarm settings* window.
> - Any settings configured in the *Anomaly alarm settings* window will only affect parameters that are being trended.

#### Security enhancements [ID_37267]

<!-- RN 37267: MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.11 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Button to show focused alarms now shows the number of focused alarms [ID_37455]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

From now on, the button to only show the focused alarms in the current alarm tab will show the number of focused alarms in the current alarm tab and will only be visible when the alarm tab actually contains focused alarms.

#### DataMiner Cube - Surveyor: Enhanced processing of alarm statistics [ID_37552]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

In the Surveyor, statistical alarm data can be displayed next to elements, services and views. A number of enhancements have now been made to enhance the processing of those alarm statistics.

#### DataMiner Cube: Caching enhancements [ID_37553]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

A number of general enhancements have been made with regard to cache management.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: RBW and VBW settings can now be modified by means of plus and minus buttons [ID_37601]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

In the *View* tab of a spectrum card, you can change the *RBW* (Resolution bandwidth) and *VBW* (Video bandwidth) settings.

Up to now, these could be modified by means of a drop-down box. From now on, they can be modified by means of "+" (plus) and "-" (minus) buttons.

#### Page size when retrieving element data from Cassandra has been set to 5000 [ID_37673]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

For performance reasons, the page size when retrieving element data from a Cassandra database has been changed from 50000 to 5000.

> [!NOTE]
> When retrieving element data from a MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server database, the page size remains set to 50000.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: New marker button 'Center to marker frequency' [ID_37705]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

In the *View* tab of a spectrum card, up to now, each marker listed in the *Markers* section had two buttons next to it: an *Edit* button (i.e. a pencil icon) and a *Delete* button (i.e. a cross icon). A *Center to marker frequency* button has now been added. Clicking this button will set the center frequency to the frequency of the marker in question.

Also, the three buttons will now show a tooltip when you hover over them.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Page loading times are now logged in SLClient.txt [ID_38636] [ID_38694]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 [CU0] -->

The time it takes to load a visual overview will now be logged in the *SLClient.txt* log file.

The load time will be the time between page initialization and (a) the time at which the page is fully loaded or (b) the time at which the user closes the card.

Page loads will time out after 2 minutes.

Note that these *SLClient.txt* entries will also include the name of the page that was loaded.

### Fixes

#### Problem when restarting DataMiner [ID_37112]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU8] - FR 10.3.10 -->

When DataMiner was restarted, in some rare cases, it would not start up again.

#### NATSCustodian could incorrectly pick an offline DMA as NAS candidate [ID_37312]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

Up to now, when NATSCustodian had to pick a NAS candidate, in some cases, it could pick a DataMiner Agent that was offline, causing an error to occur when trying to copy the credentials.

From now on, it will only be possible to trigger a NATS configuration reset when all DataMiner Agents in the cluster are online/running.

#### Updated dynamic IP address would incorrectly be applied to all connections of an element [ID_37445]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

When a parameter that was used to store the dynamic IP address of an element connection was updated, the dynamic IP address would incorrectly be applied to all connections of that element when the element was restarted.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Alarm tab filter would not be re-evaluated when the focus score of an alarm was updated [ID_37475]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

When an alarm in a filtered alarm tab received a focus score update, the system would incorrectly not re-evaluate whether that alarm still matched the filter that was applied.

#### Element connections would not work with destination tables that had naming configured [ID_37478]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

Element connections would not work with destination tables that had naming configured.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Display issues when a correlation alarm was based on another correlation alarm [ID_37497]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

When a correlation rule was based on another correlation rule, display issues could occur in the Alarm Console.

When the main correlation alarm got cleared, the base alarm would no longer be shown in the alarm tab, and when the base alarm got updated, it would be shown twice: once as the source of the other correlation alarm and once as a regular alarm.

#### DataMiner Cube: Problem when trying to display broadcast messages while being used as a service [ID_37524]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

When Cube tried to display a broadcast message it had received from the DataMiner Agent while being used as a service by SLHelper, an error could occur in the latter.

From now on, Cube will disregard broadcast messages while being used as a service (e.g. when displaying a visual overview on a mobile device).

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Problem when making changes to a spectrum monitor [ID_37542]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

When you create a spectrum monitor, you can define a parameter and select a number of measurement points. Each combination of a parameter and a measurement point then is assigned an ID.

Up to now, when you made a change to a spectrum monitor, in some cases, the ID of certain parameter/measurement point combinations could change even when the parameter or the measurement points had not been changed.

#### DELT export/import did not correctly include mask status [ID_37557]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->
<!-- For 10.2.0 branch, only mask status issue was merged -->

When a DELT export package was created, the mask status of elements and alarms was not correctly included in the package. The mask status was also not correctly imported when such a package was imported.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Problem when changing the alignment of an alarm property column [ID_37574]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

When, in the Alarm Console, you add a column showing an alarm property you are allowed to edit, all cells in that column will display a pencil icon you can click to update a particular value.

Up to now, when you changed the alignment of such a column, the pencil icons would disappear and the new alignment would not be applied. From now on, when you change the alignment of a column showing an alarm property you are allowed to edit, the new alignment will be applied correctly and the pencil icons will stay visible. However, regardless of the alignment, the pencil icons will stay on the left, and when you change a value, the text box will also be aligned to the left.

#### PropertyChangeEvents would not be removed from the SLNet event cache when an element was deleted [ID_37576]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

When an element was deleted, `PropertyChangeEvent` instances for that element would incorrectly not get removed from the SLNet event cache.

#### Alerter: Problem when connecting to a DataMiner Agent using gRPC [ID_37580]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

When Alerter connected to a DataMiner Agent using gRPC, on each subsequent startup, it would display a message box showing the following error:

`There is no connection available, please add one.`

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Text-to-speech button would overlap the counter showing the number of alarms with severity 'Suggestion' [ID_37590]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

In the footer of the Alarm Console, the button to cancel the current text-to-speech operation would overlap the counter showing the number of alarms with severity "Suggestion" in the current alarm tab.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Focus score would not be updated correctly when an alarm was duplicated [ID_37600]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

When, in the Alarm Console, an alarm was duplicated, in some cases, its focus score would not be updated correctly.

#### DataMiner Cube - Relation learning: Problem when checking ModelHost DxM license [ID_37653]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 [CU0] -->

In some cases, DataMiner Cube could become unresponsive when checking the ModelHost DxM license.

#### DataMiner Cube: Problem when parsing anomaly alarms [ID_37680]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 -->

When you opened DataMiner Cube or when you opened a new alarm tab, an error could occur when parsing anomaly alarms.

#### Protocol VDX files imported via a DELT package would not be displayed until a DataMiner restart [ID_37781]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 [CU0] -->

When you imported a DELT package that contained protocol VDX files linked to elements in the package, in some rare cases, those VDX files would incorrectly not be displayed until after a DataMiner restart.

#### SLNetClientTest tool would not indicate that a profile migration to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch had failed due to a profile object with an invalid name [ID_37808]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 [CU0] -->

When, in the SLNetClientTest tool, you went to *Advanced > Migration*, the migration overview would not indicate that a migration of profiles towards Elasticsearch/OpenSearch had failed due to a profile object with a name longer than 32,766 characters.

#### Profile migrations to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch will now fail when the profiles.xml file is corrupt [ID_37818]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU9] - FR 10.3.12 [CU0] -->

When you started a profile migration to an Elasticsearch/OpenSearch database while the *profiles.xml* file was corrupt, up to now, a new empty *profiles.xml* file would be created and the migration would continue. From now on, no new *profiles.xml* file will be created anymore and the migration will go into an error status.

> [!NOTE]
> When, in the SLNetClientTest tool, you go to *Advanced > Migration*, all migrations in an error status will now have a red background.

#### Web apps - Visual overview: Popup window would not display a hidden page when the visual overview only contained one non-hidden page [ID_38331]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21] / 10.3.0 [CU12] / 10.4.0 [CU0] - - FR 10.4.3 [CU0] -->

When, in a visual overview with one non-hidden page displayed in a web app, you tried to open a popup window linked to a page marked as "hidden", the popup window would incorrectly display the non-hidden page instead of the hidden page.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: No longer possible to add additional databases when DMA was using STaaS [ID_38399]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 [CU0] -->

In *System Center*, the *Other* tab of the *Database* section allows you to configure additional databases.

Up to now, when Cube was connected to a DataMiner Agent configured to use STaaS, an error could occur when you tried to add an additional database.

#### Visual Overview: Problem with subscription filter on 'Children' shape [ID_38537]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU21]/10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.2 [CU0] -->

When a subscription filter was configured on a *Children* shape, it would not get parsed correctly, causing the filter to malfunction.
