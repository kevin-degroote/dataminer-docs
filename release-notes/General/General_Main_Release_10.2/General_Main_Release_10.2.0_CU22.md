### Enhancements

#### Security enhancements [ID_37641]

<!-- 37641: MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Enhanced service chain behavior [ID_37645]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

A number of UI enhancements have been made with regard to service chain behavior in visual overviews.

Up to now, in some cases, service chains could get redrawn too often, or shapes would not get redrawn when a service chain was updated. Also, context menus of shapes would not always close when those shapes were updated and context menus would incorrectly show the *Display connectivity* command twice.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum analysis: Zooming inside a spectrum window [ID_37668]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

It is now possible to zoom inside a spectrum window:

- To zoom horizontally, scroll up and down. This has the same effect as altering the frequency span.
- To zoom vertically, scroll up and down while pressing the CTRL key. This has the same effect as altering the amplitude scale.

When you stop scrolling, the new zoom dimensions will be set on the spectrum analyzer device and the screen will be updated with the new data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - It is only possible to zoom horizontally if the spectrum protocol includes the *Start frequency*, *Stop frequency* and *Frequency span* parameters.
> - It is only possible to zoom vertically if the spectrum protocol includes the *Amplitude scale* parameter.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Buttons in 'Reference lines' panel, 'Thresholds' panel and 'Measurement Points' panel have been restyled [ID_37752]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In the *View* tab of a spectrum card, the buttons in the *Reference lines* panel and the *Thresholds* panel as well as the delete buttons in the *Measurement Points* panel have been restyled to match the buttons in the *Markers* panel.

#### Enhanced performance when locking or unlocking inputs and output of matrices in client applications [ID_37755]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when locking or unlocking inputs and output of matrices in client applications.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Enhanced performance when opening a visual overview with a large amount of shapes that link to a webpage [ID_37799]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when opening a visual overview with a large amount of shapes that link to a webpage.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum Analysis: Editing the X-axis and Y-axis labels [ID_37821]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In a spectrum view, it is now possible to modify the center frequency and reference level.

To modify the center frequency:

1. Click the pencil icon next to the center frequency X-axis label.
1. Use the up/down buttons to change the center frequency.
1. Click *Confirm* or press ENTER.

To modify the reference level:

1. Click the pencil icon next to the reference level Y-axis label.
1. Use the up/down buttons to change the reference level.
1. Click *Confirm* or press ENTER.

> [!NOTE]
> To change the unit of either the center frequency or the reference level, go to the settings menu on the right.

#### Protocols: Buffer for SNMP responses now has a dynamic size [ID_37824]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

Up to now, when an SNMP response was received, a buffer with a fixed size of 10240 characters was used to translate the response to the requested format (e.g. OctetStringUTF8). When the response was larger that 10240 characters, it was cut off.

From now on, the buffer will have a dynamic size. This allow larger responses to be processed, and will also make sure that less memory has to be reserved when smaller responses are received.

#### DataMiner Cube - Trending: Relation learning light bulb enhancements [ID_37834]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

The checks run to decide whether to show the relation learning light bulb in the top-right corner of a trend graph window have been optimized.

Also, this light bulb can now have the following states, which will indicate why it is not yet showing any results:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Checking requirements | The light bulb is still checking whether all requirements are met. |
| Loading               | The light bulb is fetching the relations. |

> [!NOTE]
> The following prerequisites are now optional instead of mandatory:
>
> - *DataMiner CloudFeed* version 1.1.0 or higher
> - *Allow performance and usage data offload* option

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: New alarm tab showing current suggestion events now has the 'Automatically remove cleared alarms' option enabled by default [ID_37855]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When you add a new alarm tab showing the current suggestion events, that tab will now have the *Automatically remove cleared alarms* option enabled by default.

This means that suggestion events will automatically disappear from the tab approximately 2 hours after they have been detected.

#### DataMiner Cube: Optimization of memory handling when closing cards [ID_37858]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.2 -->

Overall memory handling when closing cards has been optimized.

#### DataMiner Cube - Settings: Default values of trend graph action settings have been changed [ID_37867]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In the *Settings* window, the default values of the following trend graph action settings have been changed:

| Setting | New default value |
|---------|-------------------|
| Right mouse button action on graph         | Select |
| Hotkey + left mouse button action on graph | Zoom   |

#### DataMiner Cube - Protocols & Templates: Clicking Help will now open the protocol's help page on 'DataMiner Connector Documentation' [ID_37873]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When, in the *Protocols & Templates* app, you right-click a protocol in the *Protocols* list and select *Help*, a new browser window will now open, showing the protocol's help page on [DataMiner Connector Documentation](https://docs.dataminer.services/connector/index.html).

> [!NOTE]
> That same help page will appear when, in an element card, you open the hamburger menu and select *Help*.

#### DataMiner Cube - Service templates: Scrollbar added inside every tab of a service template card [ID_37882]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the service template card, one of which is a scrollbar added inside every tab.

#### DataMiner Cube - Desktop application: New command-line argument 'UseInitialArgumentsAfterDisconnect' [ID_37888]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

You can now start the DataMiner Cube desktop application with the new command-line argument *UseInitialArgumentsAfterDisconnect=true*.

This argument will make sure that all other arguments you specified when you started the application will again be applied when Cube has to reconnect for some reason.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm templates: Enhanced selection box in 'Anomaly alarm settings' window [ID_37899]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

The selection box at the top of the *Anomaly alarm settings* window has now been made wider in order to better accommodate content in languages other than English.

#### DataMiner Cube: Legacy Reports, Dashboards and Annotations modules are now end-of-life and will be disabled by default [ID_37935]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

As from DataMiner versions 10.1.10/10.2.0, the *LegacyReportsAndDashboards* and/or *LegacyAnnotations* soft-launch options allowed you to enable or disable the legacy *Reports*, *Dashboards* and *Annotations* modules. By default, they were enabled.

Now, the above-mentioned soft-launch options will be disabled by default, causing the legacy *Reports*, *Dashboards* and *Annotations* modules to be hidden. If you want to continue using these modules, which are now considered end-of-life, you will have to explicitly enable the soft-launch options.

In DataMiner Cube, all buttons related to these modules will now by default also be hidden.

#### DataMiner Cube - Spectrum analysis: Zero span mode [ID_37946]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

Spectrum windows now support zero span mode.

To enter zero span mode, set the frequency span to 0. The X axis will then change from a frequency axis to a time axis, and all frequency-related features will be disabled.

In zero span mode, the sweeptime parameter is used to indicate the time on the X axis:

- Left: 0
- Right: Sweeptime

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: All alarms tabs listing suggestion events now have the 'Automatically remove cleared alarms' option enabled by default [ID_38034]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

From now on, all alarm tabs listing suggestion events will behave like alarm tabs listing active alarms, i.e. the *Automatically remove cleared alarms* option will be enabled by default, except for alarm tabs listing historical alarms or information events.

#### DataMiner Cube - Search: Request to initialize client indexing will only be sent when the user has AdminTools permission [ID_38090]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When, in *System Center > Search & Indexing*, the *Enable search indexing on the client* option was enabled, up to now, DataMiner Cube would send a message to the DataMiner Agent requesting to initialize client indexing, regardless of whether or not the user had *Admin tools* permission (*Modules > System configuration > Tools*). When the user had not been granted this permission, an `Exception occurred while receiving search options` error would be logged.

From now on, before it sends the message in question to the DataMiner Agent, DataMiner Cube will first check whether the user has *Admin tools* permission. If not, it will not send the message.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Enhanced performance when loading history alarms of a view, a service or an element dragged onto the Alarm Console [ID_38141]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.2 -->

Up to now, when you dragged a view, a service or an element onto the Alarm Console, and indicated that you wanted history alarms of that view, service or element to be loaded, it could take a long time for those alarms to get loaded.

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when loading the history alarms of a view, a service or an element dragged onto the Alarm Console.

> [!NOTE]
> When indicating that an alarm tab should list history alarms, it is no longer possible to select the *Show masked alarms* option. From now on, all masked alarms will automatically be included when history alarms are loaded.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: 'Install Indexing Engine' button removed [ID_38145]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.2 -->

Up to now, you could go to *System Center > Search & Indexing* and click *Install Indexing Engine* to install an Elasticsearch database on a DataMiner Agent to which Cube was connected. This button has now been removed.

Elasticsearch is only supported up to version 6.8, which is no longer supported by Elastic. We recommend using OpenSearch instead, ideally with a dedicated clustered storage setup. Using storage per DMA with OpenSearch is also possible; in that case you will first need to install an OpenSearch database (ideally on a separate Linux server), and then connect your DMS to the OpenSearch database.

#### DataMiner Cube - Data Display: Enhanced performance when loading partial tables [ID_38155]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.2 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when loading partial tables in DataMiner Cube.

#### DataMiner Cube - System Center: Database setting "CloudStorage" renamed to "STaaS" [ID_38325]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

In the *Database* section of *System Center*, up to now, when a DataMiner Agent was configured to use Storage as a Service (STaaS), the *Database* setting was set to "CloudStorage". This "CloudStorage" value has now been renamed to "STaaS".

Also, when *Database* is set to "STaaS", the *Configuration* and *Maintenance* sections will no longer be visible in both the *General* and *Offload* tabs, and the *Cassandra preparation/migration* button will be hidden.

#### DataMiner Cube: Enhanced operator support when constructing filters for numeric columns of partial tables [ID_38367]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

From now on, the following operators are supported in filters for numeric columns of partial tables:

```txt
<
<=
>
>=
==
!=
```

#### DataMiner Cube: Incident alarms and correlation alarms will now be processed separately [ID_38389]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

In order to enhance overall performance, incident alarms and correlation alarms will now be processed separately.

#### DataMiner Cube: Property names identical to names of existing properties except for leading or trailing whitespace characters will no longer be allowed [ID_38424]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When creating a new property, from now on, it will no longer be allowed to use a name that is identical to the name of an existing property except for a number of leading and/or trailing whitespace characters. For example, the name "myproperty " (with a trailing whitespace character) will no longer be accepted when there is a property named "myproperty" (without whitespace characters).

> [!NOTE]
> Property names will now be trimmed before being saved.

#### DataMiner Cube - Service templates: Enhanced performance when reapplying a service template [ID_38463]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when reapplying a service template.

#### CubeConnection entry will now be added to the SLClient.txt log file each time a Cube client has fully connected to a DMA [ID_38574]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

Each time a Cube client has fully connected to a DataMiner Agent, a *CubeConnection* entry will now be added to the *SLClient.txt* log file of the DataMiner Agent in question.

This entry will contain the following information:

- The DataMiner Cube version
- The name of the client computer that is running DataMiner Cube
- The creation time of the connection (in ISO 8601 format)
- The ID of the connection
- The type of the current connection: "Auto", "Remoting", "WebServices" or "Grpc"
- The type of the last disconnect: "AbnormalClose", "Logout", "NoActivity", "Close", "FailedConnection", "NewConnection" or "Refresh"
- The reason of the last disconnect (depending on the type of the last disconnect)
- The hostname of the non-resolved connection URL
- The connected hostname
- The raw text of the client connection (includes connection property data such as *AmountCallsIn*, *AmountCallsOut*, *AmountInitiatedConnectionChecks*, *AmountCallsInProgress*, *AmountCallsWaiting*, etc.)

#### DataMiner Cube - Logging: Viewing the logging of enhanced services [ID_38623]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

In Cube, you can now view the logging of an enhanced service by doing one of the following:

- Open the card of an enhanced service, open its hamburger menu, and choose *View > Log*.
- In the Surveyor, right-click an enhanced service, and choose *View > Log*.

### Fixes

#### DataMiner Cube: Error could occur in SLHelper when generating visual overviews to be displayed in web apps [ID_32584]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU13]/10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.4 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in SLHelper when it was generating visual overviews to be displayed in web apps.

#### DataMiner Cube: Problem when adding up [Start Time:] placeholders [ID_37661]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU11] - FR 10.4.2 -->

When the [Sum:] placeholder was used to add [Start Time:] placeholders, in some cases, the sum would not be correct.

From now on, when configuring [Start Time:] placeholders that will be used in Sum operations, a format will have to be specified.

#### DataMiner Cube - Alarm Console: Reports view button would not be shown [ID_38398]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

On undocked alarm cards or alarm consoles that were embedded in e.g. elements cards, in some cases, the reports view button would incorrectly not be shown.

#### DataMiner Cube - Visual Overview: Parsing problem when using a custom separator inside a [param:] placeholder [ID_38405]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When a custom separator was used inside a [param:] placeholder referring to a table parameter value, the retrieved value would not be parsed correctly.

#### DataMiner Cube - Automation: Problem when selecting 'User interaction' in the 'Add action' box [ID_38406]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When, while creating or editing an Automation script, you opened the *Add action* selection box and selected "User interaction", in some cases, an exception could be thrown.

#### DataMiner Cube - Protocols & templates: Problem when creating alarm templates or trend templates due to casing issue [ID_38456]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

In DataMiner Cube, you can create a new alarm template or trend template from within an element card by clicking the hamburger menu and selecting *Protocols & Templates > Assign alarm template > \<New alarm template\>* or *Protocols & Templates > Assign trend template > \<New trend template\>*.

Up to now, when the protocol name or protocol version of the element had a casing that was different from that of the protocol itself, in some cases, the protocol would incorrectly not be found.

From now on, protocol comparisons will be performed case-insensitively.

#### DataMiner Cube - Settings: Description of 'Filter the alarms before they enter Cube' setting did not fit the screen [ID_38493]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

In the *Settings* windows, the description of the *Filter the alarms before they enter Cube* setting did not fit the screen. The text would be wrapped incorrectly.

#### DataMiner Cube - Redundancy groups: Problem with imported elements [ID_38505]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When editing a correlation rule in which a *Set Parameter* action had previously been configured, up to now, enabling or disabling any of the options for that action (e.g. *Execute on base alarm updates*) would incorrectly not enable the *Apply* button. As a result, it would not be possible to save the correlation rule after enabling or disabling some of those options.

#### DataMiner Cube: Sidebar would not contain any buttons [ID_38652]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU12]/10.4.0 [CU0] - FR 10.4.3 -->
