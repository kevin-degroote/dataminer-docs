### Enhancements

#### Elasticsearch/OpenSearch: Enhanced log entry when creating a custom data storage fails [ID_26965]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When an attempt to create a custom data storage fails, the log entry will now also mention the data storage type.

Former log entry:

`Cannot create a custom data table for Elastic when Elastic is not active.`

New log entry:

`Cannot create a custom data table for {typeof(T)} in Elastic when Elastic is not active.`

#### Security enhancements [ID_37641]

<!-- 37641: MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Flatline suggestion events will now automatically be cleared after a set amount of time [ID_37716]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

Similar to other types of anomaly suggestion events, flatline suggestion events will now also be cleared automatically after a set amount of time.

> [!NOTE]
> Flatline alarms stay open until the flatline in question disappears or SLAnalytics is restarted.

#### Enhanced performance when locking or unlocking inputs and output of matrices in client applications [ID_37755]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

Because of a number of enhancements, overall performance has increased when locking or unlocking inputs and output of matrices in client applications.

#### Protocols: Buffer for SNMP responses now has a dynamic size [ID_37824]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

Up to now, when an SNMP response was received, a buffer with a fixed size of 10240 characters was used to translate the response to the requested format (e.g. OctetStringUTF8). When the response was larger that 10240 characters, it was cut off.

From now on, the buffer will have a dynamic size. This allow larger responses to be processed, and will also make sure that less memory has to be reserved when smaller responses are received.

#### Behavioral anomaly detection: Flatline detection now takes into account the decimal precision of parameter values [ID_37828]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

From now on, the flatline detection algorithm will take into account the decimal precision of parameter values displayed in client applications.

### Fixes

#### DELT: Trend data missing in DELT package after exporting tables with primary keys of type string [ID_37664]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When you exported tables of which the primary keys were of type string, the DELT export package would incorrectly not contain any trend data.

#### Attempt to update a deleted service would incorrectly cause that service to re-appear [ID_37679]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In some rare cases, if an attempt was made to update a service that had just been deleted, the service could re-appear.

Additional logging has now been added to allow better tracing of errors that occur while creating or updating services.

#### Problem with SLDataGateway during a Cassandra Cluster migration [ID_37684]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

SLDataGateway would leak memory during a Cassandra Cluster migration.

#### Problem with remote clients after restarting a DMA in a gRPC-only cluster [ID_37726]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When a DataMiner System was configured to use gRPC connections only (i.e. when *EnableDotNetRemoting* was set to false on all agents), in some cases, remote clients would not get properly registered with SLDataMiner after restarting a DataMiner Agent. This would cause remote requests to fail if they had to be handled by SLDataMiner on the DataMiner Agent that was restarted.

#### SLAnalytics: Problem when the alarm repository was not available at startup [ID_37782]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In some cases, an error could occur in SLAnalytics when it was not able to connect to the alarm repository at startup.

#### Entire SNMPv3 response would be discarded when one or more cells contained 'no such instance' [ID_37815]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU22]/10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When a table was polled via SNMPv3 and the response included a cell that contained *no such instance*, the table would not get populated with the values that were received. Instead, the entire result set would be discarded.

#### Reports for DVE elements would show either incorrect alarm information or no alarm information at all [ID_37816]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When, in e.g. DataMiner Cube, you double-clicked a parameter of a DVE element and navigated to the *Details* tab, in some cases, the reports would show either incorrect alarm information or no alarm information at all.

The same issue would occur when, in DataMiner Cube, you opened an element card and navigated to *Reports > General*.

#### Cassandra Cluster: Failover setups would incorrectly report errors when the cluster status was yellow [ID_37868]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

When a Cassandra Cluster was in a yellow state because a number of nodes were down, up to now, Failover setups within the system would incorrectly report errors.

From now on, Failover setups within the system will only report errors if the Cassandra Cluster is in a red state.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Incorrect flatline stops could be generated [ID_37903]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In some cases, incorrect flatline stops could be generated.

#### SLAutomation would not properly cleanup deleted references to elements [ID_37907]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU10] - FR 10.4.1 -->

In some rare cases, SLAutomation would not clean up deleted references to elements, causing the process to stop unexpectedly when the Automation script ended.
