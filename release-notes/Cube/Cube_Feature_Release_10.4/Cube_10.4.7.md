#### Alarm Console: Undocked alarm card would not indicate which view was selected [ID_39494]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU16] / 10.4.0 [CU4] - FR 10.4.7 -->

When you undocked an alarm tab or you opened the *Alarms* tab of a card, it would not be possible to see whether the list view, the statistical view or the reports view was selected. From now on, the selected view will be indicated clearly.
