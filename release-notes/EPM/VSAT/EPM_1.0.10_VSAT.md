## Changes

### Enhancements

*No enhancements have been added to this release yet.*

### Fixes

#### Verizon iDirect Evolution Platform Collector: Error related to circuit availability on startup [ID_39064]

When an element using the Verizon iDirect Evolution Platform Collector connector was started, errors could be thrown related to the circuit availability logic. These were caused by the *GetParameterIndexByKey* method returning null because the IDs had not yet been assigned to the circuit table.

#### Newtec Dialog Platform VSAT: Incorrect Hub Forward and Return Count KPIs [ID_39191]

On the *General* page of Newtec Dialog Platform VSAT elements, the Hub Forward and Return Count KPIs did not match the total count of rows found in the Hub Forward and Hub Return tables, respectively. Instead these were incorrectly based on the total count of rows from the Forward/Return Links tables.
