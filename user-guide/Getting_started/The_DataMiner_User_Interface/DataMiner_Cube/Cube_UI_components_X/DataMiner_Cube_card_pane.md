# Card pane

When you open an item in Cube, e.g. an element or an app, it is opened in a so-called card in the large, central pane of the Cube UI.

For more information, see [Working with cards in DataMiner Cube](xref:Working_with_cards_in_DataMiner_Cube).

## Card header bar buttons

At the top of each card, there can be several buttons:

![Header bar buttons](~/user-guide/images/Card_Header_Bar.png)<br/>*Card pane in DataMiner 10.4.1*

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ![Hamburger button](~/user-guide/images/CubeXCardBurger.png) | Hamburger button in the top-left corner of a card. Provides access to a shortcut menu with a number of commands. See [Card header bar menu](xref:Working_with_cards_in_DataMiner_Cube#card-header-bar-menu). |
| ![Back button](~/user-guide/images/CubeXCardBack.png) | Back button. When you have gone from one card to another, this button becomes available, allowing you to go back to a previous card. From DataMiner 10.0.10 onwards, this button goes to the previous open page, which can be on the same card. |
| ![Maximize button](~/user-guide/images/CubeXCardMax.png) | Maximize button. Click this button to expand a card to its maximal size. Only displayed if more than one card is opened in a layout other than the tab layout. |
| ![Restore button](~/user-guide/images/CubeXCardRestore.png) | Restore button. If a card has been maximized, use this button to restore it to its previous size. Only displayed if more than one card is opened in a layout other than the tab layout. |
| ![Close button](~/user-guide/images/CubeXCardClose.png) | Close button. Shift-click the button to close all open cards. |
| ![Fullscreenbutton](~/user-guide/images/CubeMaximize.png) | Fullscreen button. Displayed in the top-right corner of a data page, a visual page, or a trending page. Expands the page over the entire Cube UI. To exit this fullscreen mode, click the button again. |

> [!NOTE]
> To move back and forward between the Visual Overview pages of different cards, use the *Back* and *Forward* options in the right-click menu of the page.
