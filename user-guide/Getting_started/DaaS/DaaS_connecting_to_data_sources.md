# Connecting to data sources using a DaaS system

To connect to data sources so that you can see their information in DataMiner, you need to [create DataMiner elements](xref:Adding_elements).

However, if you are using a DaaS system, by default you will only be able to access data sources that can be accessed from dataminer.services over the internet.

If this is not sufficient, contact <daas@dataminer.services> to have an [Azure VPN Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) set up for you, in order to establish a secured connection between your DaaS system and your self-hosted network (which can be on-premises or hosted by the cloud provider of your choice).
