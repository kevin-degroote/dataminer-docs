# Removing a DaaS system

> [!WARNING]
> When you remove a DaaS system, this is **irreversible**, and **all data of the system will be lost**.

1. On the dataminer.services page, click the ellipsis ( "...") button in the top-right corner of the box representing the system and select *Delete DMS*.

1. Fill in the name of the system to confirm that this is the system you want to remove.

1. Click *Delete*.

> [!NOTE]
> If you select *Delete DMS* for a self-hosted DataMiner System instead of a DaaS system, this will disconnect the system from dataminer.services. See [Permanently disconnecting from dataminer.services](xref:Disconnecting_from_dataminer.services#permanently-disconnecting-from-dataminerservices).
