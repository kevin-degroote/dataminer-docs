# DataMiner client apps

Several client apps are available that allow you to interact with a DataMiner System:

- **DataMiner Cube**: This is the main DataMiner client application. With Cube, you can fully monitor and configure your DataMiner System. Most operators will mainly rely on this app.

  - To use DataMiner Cube, you will need to [install it first](xref:Installing_configuring_the_DataMiner_Cube_software). Cube [requires a Windows environment](xref:DataMiner_Client_Requirements).

  - Once you have installed Cube, you can [connect to your DataMiner System](xref:Using_the_desktop_app) or to any other DataMiner System you have access to.

- **DataMiner Monitoring app**: This is the main web application to monitor a DataMiner System. While it has more limited functionality than DataMiner Cube, it is more easily accessible, as you can open it in any modern browser.

  For more information on how to access a DataMiner System with this app, see [Accessing the Monitoring app](xref:Accessing_the_Monitoring_app).

- With the [Dashboards app and Low-Code Apps](xref:Dashboards_and_Low_Code_Apps), you can easily create custom dashboards and apps that provide access to specific information and functionality. This way you can give users limited access to only those data and features they need.

In addition to this, many [tools](xref:DataminerTools) are available, such as the [Alerter app](xref:Accessing_Alerter) to get alarm notifications on your desktop, or the [DataMiner&nbsp;Taskbar Utility](xref:Accessing_the_DataMiner_Taskbar_Utility) for DataMiner administrators, and it is also possible to interact with DataMiner via the [DataMiner Web APIs](xref:WS_v1).
