# DataMiner modules

A DataMiner System can have several additional modules or apps. Depending on the type of DataMiner license you have, these may or may not be available in your system. However, as some of these modules are mentioned quite often throughout this documentation, it is useful to know what they are, even if you will not use them yourself.

| Module | Description |
|--|--|
| [Automation](xref:automation) | A module used to create scripts that can execute certain tasks automatically. Scripts can for instance set parameters, change element states, send notifications, etc. |
| [Business Intelligence](xref:sla) | A module used to track the parameters of a Service Level Agreement or SLA. It allows the creation of a special type of element, an SLA element, that monitors the SLA information related to a particular DataMiner service. |
| [Correlation](xref:About_DMS_Correlation) | A module that can gather information about parameter values and alarms, and trigger specific actions, such as generating a new, correlated alarm, based on triggers defined by the user. |
| [Dashboards and Low-Code Apps](xref:Dashboards_and_Low_Code_Apps) | These modules allow you to create and manage dashboards, i.e. pages displaying information about components of the DataMiner System, and low-code apps, i.e. apps combining multiple such pages, with added functionality. |
| [Scheduler](xref:About_the_Scheduler_module) | A module that can schedule certain actions in the DataMiner System. It works in close relation with the Automation module. |
| [Spectrum Analysis](xref:SpectrumAnalysis) | A module that allows the integration of spectrum analyzers in a DataMiner System. |
| System Center | A DataMiner Cube module that contains many DataMiner administrator functionalities, such as management of [users](xref:About_DMS_Security) and [DataMiner Agents](xref:DataminerAgents). |
| [Apps](xref:Part5StandardApps) | DataMiner can have countless custom-made apps, designed specifically for a particular vendor or technology. There are also standard apps available, which combine different DataMiner features into a ready-made package that can easily be deployed on a DataMiner System. The package contains all the necessary components and default configurations, including protocols, views, Automation scripts, etc. Certain DataMiner features and licenses can be required as prerequisites, depending on the app. |
