> [!IMPORTANT]
> This information is applicable to the DMS Dashboards module, which is being retired as of DataMiner version 10.4.x. See [DataMiner functionality evolution and retirement](xref:Software_support_life_cycles#dataminer-functionality-evolution-and-retirement). For more information on the Dashboards web app available from DataMiner 9.6.9 onwards, see [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D).

It is possible to organize dashboards and dashboard containers in folders. In this case, they will be displayed in the dashboard list in the format \[Folder name\]/\[Dashboard name or dashboard container name\].

To do so:

1. Click the pencil icon to edit the dashboard or dashboard container.

2. On the right, next to *FOLDER*, choose the folder in the drop-down list, or choose *\<Create New>* and type the new folder name in the field below.

3. Click the Save icon in the top-right corner.
