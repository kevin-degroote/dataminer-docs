# Configuring a custom operator for a query

The custom operator is available from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU10]/10.4.1 onwards.<!-- RN 37840 --> Prior to this, starting from DataMiner 10.2.7/10.3.0, it is available in preview if the [*GenericInterface* soft-launch option](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options#genericinterface) is enabled.

The custom operator has a [life cycle](xref:CO_Life_cycle) of its own and implements [predefined interfaces to add the desired functionality](xref:CO_Building_blocks).
