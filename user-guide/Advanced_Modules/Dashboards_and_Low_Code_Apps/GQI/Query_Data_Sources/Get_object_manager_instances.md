# Get object manager instances

The *Get object manager instances* data source retrieves [DOM instances](xref:DomInstance). To use this data source, an indexing database is required and you need to have at least one [DOM](xref:DOM) module defined in your DMS. When you configure the data source, you will first need to select the module the instance belongs to.<!-- RN 36124 -->

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to DataMiner 10.3.6, this query data source is only available if the [soft-launch option](xref:SoftLaunchOptions) *GenericInterface* is enabled.
