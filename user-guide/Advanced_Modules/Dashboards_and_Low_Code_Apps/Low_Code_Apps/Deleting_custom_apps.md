# Deleting a low-code application

You can delete a low-code app from within the app or from the DataMiner landing page.

From the DataMiner **landing page** (supported from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU10]/10.4.0 onwards<!-- RN 37830 -->):

1. Hover the mouse pointer over the app icon until you see the ellipsis ("...") button.

1. Click the ellipsis button and select *Delete*.

1. Click *Confirm*.

From **within an application**:

- From DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.2 onwards<!--RN 37878-->:

  1. Click the user icon in the top-right corner and select *Edit*.

  1. Click the user icon in the top-right corner and select *Delete app*.

  1. In the pop-up window, click *Delete*.

  > [!NOTE]
  > To delete the current draft version of the app instead, click the ![Delete draft](~/user-guide/images/Delete_Draft.png) icon next to the user icon. This draft version gets created as soon as you click *Edit*, so selecting this option will never remove a previously saved version.

- Prior to DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU11]/10.4.2:

  1. Click the user icon in the top-right corner and select *Edit*.

  1. Click the garbage can icon next to the user icon.

  1. In the pop-up window, select to delete the entire application, and click *Delete*.

     You can also select to delete the current draft version of the app instead. This draft version gets created as soon as you click *Edit*, so selecting this option will never remove a previously saved version.

> [!NOTE]
> To view, add, edit, delete, or publish low-code applications, you need to have the necessary user permissions under [Modules > User-definable apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#modules--user-definable-apps) as well as the [DataMiner web apps](xref:DataMiner_user_permissions#general--dataminer-web-apps--dataminer-cube-mobile-access) user permission.
