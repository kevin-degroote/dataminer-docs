# Editing a low-code application

You can begin editing a low-code app from within the app or from the DataMiner landing page. If you want to edit a draft app, make sure the draft applications are shown: click the cogwheel button on the landing page and activate *Show draft applications*.

From the DataMiner **landing page** (supported from DataMiner 10.3.0 [CU10]/10.4.0 onwards<!-- RN 37830 -->):

1. Hover the mouse pointer over the app icon until you see the ellipsis ("...") button.

1. Click the ellipsis button and select *Edit*.

From **within an application**:

- Click the user icon in the top-right corner and select *Edit*.

Once you are in edit mode, you can [customize the app](xref:LowCodeApps_Layout#customizing-the-icon-and-color-of-an-app), or edit the [pages](xref:LowCodeApps_page_config), [panels](xref:LowCodeApps_panel_config), [header bar](xref:LowCodeApps_header_config), [events](xref:LowCodeApps_event_config), or [security](xref:LowCodeApps_security_config) as needed.

When the app is ready, click the ![Publish](~/user-guide/images/AppPublishIcon.png) icon in the header bar to save your changes and publish it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once an app has been published, it is not possible to revert it to a draft.
