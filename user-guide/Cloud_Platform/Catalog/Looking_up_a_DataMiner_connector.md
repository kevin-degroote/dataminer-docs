# Looking up an item in the Catalog

When you open up the Catalog module, a search box is displayed.

1. In the search box, enter (part of) the name of the item you are looking for (e.g. a connector, a package, etc.).

    As you type, the list will be narrowed down.

1. As soon as you notice the name of the item you are looking for, click it.

   This will open a page where you can see information about the item and the different versions of the item.

   You can also [deploy the item to your DataMiner System](xref:Deploying_a_catalog_item) from here.
