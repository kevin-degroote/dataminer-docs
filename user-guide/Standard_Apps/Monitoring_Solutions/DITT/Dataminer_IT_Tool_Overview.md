# DataMiner IT Tools (DITT)

The DataMiner IT Tools (DITT) Solution streamlines the monitoring and diagnostic processes for connectivity within a system.

Using DITT, you can initiate ping and traceroute (tracert) commands to any device from the perspective of any system element. This way, you can get a comprehensive view of the network and potential points of failure.

You can use this solution to swiftly identify network issues, assess latency and packet loss, and map the path that data follows through the network. This facilitates rapid detection and resolution of problems, minimizing downtime and optimizing network performance.

After [installing the DITT package](xref:Installing_DITT) and [configuring a visual overview](xref:Implementing_DITT_in_Visio), you can have DataMiner ping or trace any device. To facilitate SSH connections and remote network device management, DITT also allows you to [open PuTTY](xref:Open_Putty_with_DITT), if it is installed on the client system.
