# Change connection(s)

Adding or removing one or multiple connections in a protocol is considered a major change.

Changing the type of a connection is also considered a major change, e.g. from SNMP to SNMPv3.

## Impact

- **Element reconfiguration**: Existing elements need to be reconfigured before the new connection(s) will be taken in use.

## Advised method

When an upgrade is done to a new range that has been modified for different connections, element reconfiguration is needed.

Bulk reconfiguration can be performed by means of the [export/import functionality](xref:Importing_and_exporting_elements).
