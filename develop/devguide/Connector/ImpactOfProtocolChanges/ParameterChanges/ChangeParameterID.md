# Change parameter ID

Changing the ID of a parameter is considered a major change. However, this is only the case for externally available parameters (*RTDisplay* = true).

The parameter cannot be reused in future versions. If it is reused, the entries in the database can have a different meaning.

## Impact

All references are gone.

Parameter cannot be reused in future versions.

## Workarounds

There is no workaround.
