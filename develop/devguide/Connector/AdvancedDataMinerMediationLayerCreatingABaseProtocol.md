# Creating a base protocol

A base protocol is a virtual protocol defining parameters (in the range 70000-79999) that are mapped on device-specific protocols.

To create a base protocol, provide an element type name (e.g. "IRD" or "Switch") in the *baseFor* attribute of the root *Protocol* tag.

```xml
<Protocol baseFor="IRD" xmlns="http://www.skyline.be/protocol">
<Name>Standard IRD</Name>
```

From DataMiner 9.6.2 (RN 19591) onwards, the *baseFor* attribute of the base protocol is no longer considered when a parameter is directly linked to a device protocol using the *protocol* attribute of [Mediation.LinkTo](xref:Protocol.Params.Param.Mediation.LinkTo). In such an instance, the device protocol does not need to have an element type that matches the value of the *baseFor* attribute.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - All protocols of which the *baseFor* attribute contains text are considered base protocols.
> - Only Production versions of base protocols are used. If no production version is assigned, the base protocol will be ignored.
