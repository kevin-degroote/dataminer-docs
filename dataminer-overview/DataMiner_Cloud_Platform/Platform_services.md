*Less overhead and higher availability, thanks to “as-a-service” options.*

## Health

The **Health package** is an insurance policy for your system that includes features like automated log file collection, which allows us to **provide faster support without requiring a user action**.

In addition, when you connect your DataMiner Agents to dataminer.services, your connection to our CDMR platform (Customer DataMiner Reporting) is automatically enabled. This means daily updates of your system status are sent to us, enabling **proactive support by monitoring the health of your operation**. Also, for existing DataMiner Agents reporting to CDMR, you will no longer need a mail connection to send the system health information to us.

## Storage as a Service (STaaS)

Platform services prioritize convenience. The hassle of managing your own Cassandra and OpenSearch/Elasticsearch database clusters is a thing of the past. With the scaling and complexity taken care of, you and your team can focus on the core business of your company. Our Storage as a Service (STaaS) solution streamlines your core operations by utilizing Skyline’s hosting service for your storage cluster, resulting in a significant reduction of on-premises resources, configuration, and maintenance.

This is a powerful option where we manage the storage for you, so you can save on infrastructure and IT maintenance costs.
