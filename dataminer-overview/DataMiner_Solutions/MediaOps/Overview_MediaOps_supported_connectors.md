# Supported connectors for MediaOps

For connectors that need to be able to set up flows through Flow Engineering and report as-is flows to the Flow Monitoring app, some integration work is required:

- These connectors need to implement an API that can accept a standardized message coming from Flow Engineering and translate this into commands that need to be sent to the device; so that the connection requested by Flow Engineering can effectively be set up.

- These connectors must have certain tables where they report flows monitored on the device, so that these can be visualized in the as-is flow paths in the Flow Monitoring app.

The following connectors are currently already integrated to set up and monitor flows in the MediaOps solution:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This list provides an indicative overview of connectors that are intended to be integrated with MediaOps. However, note that this list is still subject to potential changes and updates.
