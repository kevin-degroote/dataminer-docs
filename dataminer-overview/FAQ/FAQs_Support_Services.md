# Questions related to DataMiner Support Services

- **What is APA?**

  Annual Price Adjustment (APA): Automatic adjustment of sales prices reflecting current market conditions and actual cost evolutions.

- **What is APA for the current year?**

  Set by default globally at xx % (refer to Skyline Communications’ quotation for the current value)

- **Why the APA?**

  Today, we live in a rapidly changing world causing unprecedented volatile times and a general global upwards trend in the cost of goods and services all around us. It goes without saying that, as an organization, you have to deal with these already on a daily basis. As a result, the internal organizational costs are rising up significantly and to secure a long-term future several measures need to be taken.

  This is no different for Skyline Communications. Just like any other professional organization we are today forced to apply an Annual Price Adjustment (APA) (charged as a percentage on top of the pricing of the year before), covering extra costs we are currently facing in the delivery of Support Services (such as inflation, amongst others). The APA is ***not*** an increase in Skyline Communications’ margin and for the successor year the APA will be re-evaluated reflecting the inflation of that period and communicated timely to you.

  If needed, and based on a mutual agreement, we offer an alternative by opting for a multi-year agreement where we can lock the prices at a proposed rate in return for a full PO and a full pre-payment for the entire period.
  
- **What happens when my renewal of my support plan is overdue (Perpetual-Use plan only)?**

  By default, support plans renew automatically every year, unless they have been stopped by the user in advance of the end date of the plan.

  Skyline will provide you with a renewal proposal for the support services at least three months prior to the end date of your support plan. Unless you provide Skyline with a written notice of your wish not to renew the support plan no later than thirty days prior to the end date of the plan, it is automatically renewed for another year, and Skyline will invoice the amount of the renewal proposal. All amounts due to Skyline are payable up front before the provision of any support services. If you terminate the support services early, this does not entitle you to a refund.

  In case the support plan has not been deactivated, and you fail to pay your invoice(s) or issue a PO (if required) in time, on the day after the end date of the plan, the service may be stopped along with all related services linked to it. However, you can still continue to consult content and resources on the Dojo Community portal.

- **What happens if I do not have active support on a perpetual support plan?**

  - You do not have access to the Skyline IOC technical support team.
  - Your platform is exposed to technical & security vulnerabilities.
  - New purchased connectors added to your DataMiner platform are at risk to not be (fully) supported because an outdated DataMiner software version is in use.
  - You have the option to get support for the DataMiner core & connectors (except for upgrades). This is charged as [professional credit services](https://community.dataminer.services/professional-service-credits/).

- **What defines the APA percentage**

  The Annual Price Adjustment Percentage (APA%) will be determined by reference to the official inflation rates of Belgium, as publicly available on websites such as [tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com/belgium/inflation-cpi). The choice of Belgium as the relevant reference for this calculation is predicated on the significant volume of support services and the development of new software from Skyline's headquarters located in Belgium.

  On an annual basis, Skyline's leadership team will assess the official inflation trends by considering the preceding six months' data metrics and forecasting the trend for the subsequent six months. Subsequently, the APA% will be finalized and established as the new baseline for pricing in support renewals, encompassing the forthcoming period.

  The revised APA% rate will be formally communicated and integrated into the support renewal process, commencing three months prior to the anniversary date of the users' ongoing support plan.

- **How are my personal data handled?**

  If Skyline processes personal data on behalf of you in performing support services, these data will only be processed for the purpose of the support services. Skyline will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing to prevent accidental loss, destruction, damage, alteration, or disclosure. Skyline may employ its employees, affiliates, and third parties worldwide in the performance of the support services, but it will always remain the primary responsible party for the handling of your data. This may involve a transfer of personal data outside of the European Economic Area if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:

  - The personal data is transferred to a country that is recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection in relation to the data that is transferred.
  - A processing agreement that incorporates the standard model contractual clauses for data transfers approved by the European Commission is executed between the applicable parties.
