## Object Modeling

Visual representation of software or system objects, attributes, actions, and relationships.

Data modeling involves the process of creating logical representations of the data stored in an operation.

The **DataMiner Object Model (DOM)** enables the quick modeling and management of any type of **administrative or business-related data** within your DataMiner System, such as ticketing and jobs information, planned maintenance records, product catalog data, contractual and customer records, and more.
